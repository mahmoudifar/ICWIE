# [Nonclassicality of induced coherence witnessed by quantum contextuality](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.109.022216) 
The primary objective of this code is to evaluate the nonclassicality of [Zou, Wang, and Mandel's experiment](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.44.4614) using the contextuality.  Upon their investigation, it was discovered that the alignment of idler photons (path identity) from two nonlinear crystals can result in an induced coherence between the two signals, without any additional induced emission. This experiment has been employed in an enormous of recent scientific research, ranging from [quantum imaging](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13586) to [spectroscopy](https://www.nature.com/articles/nphoton.2015.252) and [quantum entanglement creation](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.080401). However, the quantum nature of this phenomenon is still a subject of debate.

In this work, we simulated a simple noncontextuality test that can used in the ZWM setup. The simulation indicates conditions under which the induced coherence by path identity leads to a non-classical result beyond the interference effect.
